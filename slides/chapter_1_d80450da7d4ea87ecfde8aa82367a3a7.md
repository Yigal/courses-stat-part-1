## About statistics at <itc>

```yaml
type: FinalSlide

```

`@script`
Statistics is the base and the core fundementals of Data Science, In fact many of the academic research in machine learning is made in the statistics departments of university.
How ever since it has very deep theoretical dept, some Data Scientist tend to dedicate either too little attention to it or to much attention to it.
For this reason it was important to us at <itc> to create an online experience that will be exactly right, that contains everything you need from this important subject but consider the limited time you have for your training
